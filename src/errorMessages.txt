re-ran testShell with new test folder, containing only 1 raw file
worked very well
However, when running lastools:

got error message:
ERROR: cannot open file 'Z:\s2559258\dissertation_AH24\data\test\sim_las\826000.0_1149352.8_p149_n104.las'

ERROR: could not open laswriter


moved to M: drive: same code, worked there...

answer: second array is wrong shape (only 1 long)
worked around by adding no data flags (-999) where this happens
